The rooms take one back in time to the original styles and designs of the 1800\\'s. A real connection to local residents, the 905 is a regular tour stop and the oldest hotel in the French Quarter. My wife and I prefer to stay in the first floor rooms where there is a sitting room with TV, bedroom, bath and kitchen. The kitchen has a stove and refrigerator, sink, coffeemaker, etc. Plus there is a streetside private entrance (very good security system) and a covered balcony area with seating so you can watch passersby. Quaint, cozy, and most of all: ORIGINAL. No plastic remods. Feels like my great Grandmother\\'s place. While there are more luxurious places to stay, if you want the real flavor and eclectic style of N.O. you have to stay here. It just FEELS like New Orleans. The location is one block towards the river from Bourbon Street and smack dab in the middle of everything. Royal street is one of the nicest residential streets in the Quarter and you can walk back to your room and get some peace and quiet whenever you like. The French Quarter is always busy so we bring a small fan to turn on to make some white noise so we can sleep more soundly. Works great. You might not need it at the 905 but it\\'s a necessity it if you stay on or near Bourbon Street, which is very loud all the time. Parking tips: You can park right in front to unload and it\\'s only a couple blocks to the secure riverfront parking area. Plus there are several public parking lots nearby. My strategy is to get there early, unload, and drive around for a while near the hotel. It\\'s not too hard to find a parking place but be careful about where it is. Stay away from corner spots since streets are narrow and delivery trucks don\\'t have the room to turn and they will hit your car. Take note of the signs. Tuesday and Thursday they clean the streets and you can\\'t park in many areas when they do or they will tow your car. Once you find a spot don\\'t move it since everything is walking distance. If you find a good spot and get a ticket it will cost $20, which is cheaper than the daily rate at most parking garages. Even if you don\\'t get a ticket make sure to go online to N.O. traffic ticket site to check your license number for violations. Some local kids think it\\'s funny to take your ticket and throw it away since the fine doubles every month it\\'s not paid. You don\\'t know you got a ticket but your fine is getting bigger. We\\'ve been coming to the French Quarter for years and have stayed at many of the local hotels. The 905 Royal is our favorite.\", \\'date\\': \\'2013-12-05 09:27:07 +0300\\', \\'ratings\\': {\\'Cleanliness\\': 5, \\'Location\\': 5, \\'Overall\\': 5, \\'Rooms\\': 5, \\'Service\\': 5, \\'Sleep Quality\\': 5, \\'Value\\': 5}}, {\\'author\\': \\'Orval Lebsack\\', \\'content\\': \\'I stayed there with a friend for a girls trip around St. Patricks Day.

Down side is no mimi bar fridge ( they are available upon request on a first come basis apparently, so book one when you make initial reservation if necessary) Bathroom is adequate with ok shower pressure and housekeeping is quick and efficient. TIP; forget paying high price for conducted local tours, just take the red trams to end of line and back and then next day the green tram to cross town garden district and zoo and museums. cost for each ride $2.00 each way!! fantastic.
